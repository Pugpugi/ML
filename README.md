#  Machine Learning
This repository serves as a diary for my machine-learning journey. I will update it as I learn new concepts.
##
## 1. Data Preprocessing 

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in  machine learning pipeline. It involves preparing raw data for further analysis or training a machine learning model. The process helps ensure that the data is clean, consistent, and in a format that models can effectively process.
